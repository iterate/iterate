# Contributing

- iterate is AGPL-licensed and we want to build a real open source community together
- Please submit issues and pull requests - we appreciate them
- We think of pull requests as high-fidelity issues with reference implementations
- It's totally fine to use coding agents to make them
- We probably won't merge them verbatim though
- We'll ask clarifying questions about your use case, then point our own coding agent at it to implement a version that fits the project
- This is faster than the back-and-forth through GitHub and through your coding agent and back to us
