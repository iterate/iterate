# Brand & tone of voice

- "iterate" is always lowercase, even at sentence start.
- Use proper capitalization when writing to customers.
- Style: simple, to the point, approachable; mild humor ok (Feynman/Karpathy/Graham vibe).
- Show, don't tell. Be concrete and concise.
- We are technical startup founders talking to other technical startup founders.
- Avoid bullshit/handwaving; define terms clearly.
