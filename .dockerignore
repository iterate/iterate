# Copied from .gitignore 
# Crucially, doesn't include .git, because we WANT to copy the .git folder into the image 
# Though we should be mindful that if .git in our build context is a file (as is the case for git worktrees),
# the git repo won't work (because the .git file points at a folder that only exists on the host)
# In practice this is fine because in local development with docker, we rsync a copy of the 
# host machine checkout and .git folder (with git worktree redirect followed) on top of the image-provided version
# And in CI we don't use worktrees when building the images
