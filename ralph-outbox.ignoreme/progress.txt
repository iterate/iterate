## 2026-02-02 15:46:57 GMT - US-001
- Ported outbox infra (pgmq library, queuer, client, consumers, type tests) and wired consumer registration on worker startup
- Files changed: apps/os/backend/outbox/*, apps/os/backend/trpc/trpc.ts, apps/os/backend/worker.ts, apps/os/backend/db/schema.ts, apps/os/backend/db/migrations/0013_outbox_event.sql, apps/os/backend/db/migrations/0014_pgmq.sql, apps/os/backend/db/migrations/0015_consumer_job_queue.sql, ralph-outbox.ignoreme/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: outbox consumers register via `registerConsumers()` and can be wired early in `apps/os/backend/worker.ts`
  - Gotchas encountered: `tag-logger` lacks `logger.run`; use direct calls in outbox lib
  - Useful context: pgmq queue setup requires both schema migration and `pgmq.create('consumer_job_queue')`
