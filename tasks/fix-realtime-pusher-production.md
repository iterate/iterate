# Fix Realtime Pusher in Production

Realtime pusher functionality is not working correctly in production. Need to investigate and fix the issue.

## Areas to investigate

- Pusher configuration and credentials in production environment
- WebSocket connection establishment
- Event subscription and broadcasting
- Any differences between local dev and production environments
