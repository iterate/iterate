# Restore the quarantined mobile approvals event-delivery e2es

The two end-to-end mobile approval and notification flows were quarantined on
2026-08-03 while landing PR #2388. That PR changes only the OS web stream-tree
model and routing; the mobile bundle does not import its route helper. The
specs instead expose an intermittent existing break between script execution,
approval intent creation, the batch shown in the thread, and the device
notification journal.

## Evidence

- The canonical preview run
  [`5g5q0jx7ft`](https://depot.dev/orgs/0p91s0lz49/workflows/8dbhw8jjqj?job=wlvh1tdz8f&attempt=42l1ltkjn1)
  failed the spec on both its initial attempt and its one test-level retry. The
  second notification row did not appear after both approval decisions had
  settled.
- A deliberate full-preview rerun
  [`mpfgwwg55b`](https://depot.dev/orgs/0p91s0lz49/workflows/7ztppxzg7d?job=552gs9p59w&attempt=q0j07bxzvd)
  failed both attempts at different boundaries. The first attempt finished the
  running-code spinner without showing the first approval batch; the retry
  completed both decisions but again journaled only one notification row.
- A single-worker invocation passed in 55.8 seconds. A subsequent three-run,
  single-worker repetition passed twice in 56.4 and 53.7 seconds, then failed
  after the running-code spinner disappeared without the first approval batch.
  This reproduces independently of the fully parallel preview lane.
- The next canonical preview run
  [`l9ltm7xhch`](https://depot.dev/orgs/0p91s0lz49/workflows/thbdr63gtq?job=dg1s6sm3g4&attempt=vwckl1b7x1)
  exposed the same defect in `specs/mobile/notifications.spec.ts` after the
  first case was skipped. Its initial attempt never rendered the expected
  suppressed-notification row; its retry never observed the root
  `notification/requested` fact for an approval batch. Both attempts exhausted
  their existing bounded waits at different transitions.
- All runs use unique projects. The failing screenshots and traces show no page
  exception or non-2xx request, and preview Worker logs show no error-level
  entry for the first two canonical runs. The missing transition is therefore
  silent today, which is itself the defect rather than evidence of a healthy
  request.

## Quarantined behavior

- CI no longer proves that a mobile-web user can approve one script burst,
  reject another with a reason, see both outcomes in the same chat, and inspect
  both batches in Notifications. It also no longer proves watched-thread push
  suppression, off-thread push sending, or the synthetic row for an approval
  parked before device enrollment.
- The two preserved Playwright cases are explicit `test.skip` calls in
  `specs/mobile/approvals.spec.ts` and `specs/mobile/notifications.spec.ts`; no
  discovery filter, timeout increase, or additional retry hides the gap.
- Other approval, script-execution, stream-delivery, and notification tests
  remain active.

## Work

- Add correlated diagnostics for every transition from script fetch hold,
  through batch creation and decision, to the device notification journal.
  A missing transition must become a bounded, classified failure rather than a
  vanished button or row.
- Minimize whether the loss occurs in the egress batching processor, the live
  thread subscription, or notification journaling, then fix the owning state
  machine without polling, broader waits, or another retry layer.
- Verify that a settled script cannot lose its approval batch or device row
  across Durable Object eviction and concurrent preview load.

## Exit criteria

- Remove the explicit skip and make the original case pass without increasing
  its timeouts or retries.
- The test asserts a durable diagnostic at the first missing transition, so a
  future failure identifies the owning processor and source offset.
- At least 25 consecutive canonical, fully parallel preview runs complete with
  no retry, silent event loss, unexplained Worker error, or missing approval or
  notification row.
