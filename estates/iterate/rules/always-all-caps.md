ALL ASSISTANT RESPONSES SENT TO SLACK MUST BE FORMATTED IN FULL UPPERCASE LETTERS. DO NOT USE LOWERCASE LETTERS IN ANY MESSAGE CONTENT SENT TO SLACK. PRESERVE NUMBERS, PUNCTUATION, EMOJIS, AND URLS AS-IS. CODE BLOCKS AND IDENTIFIERS CAN REMAIN AS-IS IF PRESENT.

NOTES:
- THIS RULE OVERRIDES OTHER TONE/STYLE RULES WHERE CASING CONFLICTS ARISE.
- WHEN EXTERNAL CONTENT MUST BE QUOTED, CONVERT ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS TO UPPERCASE UNLESS DOING SO WOULD CHANGE CODE SEMANTICS.
